### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrew and I'm DevOps... En.. gi... neer..
Oh! You even dont know how hard to tell this for me, but nowadays DevOps meaning it is mostly role, not approach. Role for Engineer who will automate all this stuff and describe your cloud as code. So, untill time we will have right job description, i will be DevOps guy. 

- ðŸŒ± Currently i'm in the world of terraform and kubernetes
- ðŸ“« You can find me in social networks, just use "wzooff" for search.
- ðŸ˜„ What does my nickname mean? I dont know, its just cool word for me.
